# Pillage-Plunder
A simple fantasy-themed real-time strategy game written in Game Maker 8.1, by Gravity Games.

This game was written over about a month in 2015 as a proof of concept for a real-time strategy game in GameMaker.
Since then, I have not done much more work on it and have therefore decided it would be best to release it under the
GNU GPL Licence. I hope that others may benefit from the source code and learn a thing or two about RTS coding for GameMaker!

In case you are not aware, the game executable is also availabe for free download at https://gravitygames.itch.io/

I did not finish porting this game to GameMaker: Studio, so some things may be broken when you attempt to import it, but
for the most part it should work. I DO NOT intend to specifically/extensively help anyone with porting this game to Studio; I
will leave that up to you. I just don't have enough time to address every question about the game you might have, but if you
contact me through email at gravity.games@outlook.com, chances are I will respond and try to help if I can. If I get some free
time to devote to porting Pillage to Studio myself, I will do so, but I can't make any guarantees.

Remember that this is now open source software - if you implement a new feature I encourage you to share with others
(so that they might share with you), and help build a community around this game. Who knows - maybe it could become the
premier example of real-time strategy in Game Maker, but that won't happen unless you're on board with the open source
philosophy of share and share alike.

The music has been removed from the original, because it was created by Kevin MacLeod, and I do not want to redistribute the
raw music files without permission. However, I have left the framework for playing music in place; it should not take you much
effort to get it working with the music of your choice.

Pillage & Plunder, as gameplay goes, is very basic, but it can serve as a base for more robust gaming experiences. It is an
RTS in the same vein as Warcraft and StarCraft.

Use workers to gather gold and construct a base, eventually building up an army to outmaneuver, overwhelm and destroy the
AI opponent. Each scenario is progressively harder, but the objective in each is clear: eradicate all the enemy forces. There
is a simple tech tree of unit and building dependencies, a single resource, and a simple rock-paper-scissors mechanic, with
soldiers meant to defeat cannons, which defeat towers, which defeat soldiers.

A lot of content was planned but ultimately cut because I just wanted to get the game released (I had been working on games
for 4 years at that time and was tired of false starts, so releasing it was a big boost for me). If you're trying to think of
ideas to add to Pillage, here's a few that were planned but never made it:

- Naval units, like transports and combat ships, built from a ship yard building.
- A second playable faction, Pirates (hence the Pillage & Plunder title - the faction you see in the game is meant to be a bit
  like the Royal Navy).
- A second gatherable resource.
- More units, like fast cavalry that required a Stables building (I made graphics for these, I will try to dig them up in the
  near future and upload them to the GitHub project for your perusal).
- Spellcasting units, that could heal others or buff their attack power.
- More tilesets, like snow or desert.
- A more robust set of game modes, including mission-briefing and objective driven campaigns, skirmish modes, and multiplayer
  modes.

There are also bugs, some of which are minor, some of which I am betting have not been discovered. If the game blows up, see
if you can fix it!

Good luck with your games!
